# For Loop 
# Sometime user need to execute a block of code multiple times

# Eample: 
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)

# Like that but it is not efficient to write the same code multiple times
# So we can use for loop to do that

# Based on simplefication there are two types of loops:
# 1. For Loop
# 2. While Loop
# For Loop is used when we know how many times we want to execute a block of code
# And While Loop is used when we don't know how many times we want to execute a block of code
# For Loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string), So it means list, tuple ,set and string are iterable objects
